// Every DART program begins with a main function

// if the function doesn't return anything, we can just main(). But void is also used in this case as well.

void main() {
  var firstName = "Charles"; // inferred as String
  String lastName = "Reed"; // explicitly defined as String

  print('Hello, my name is ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName + '.');
}
