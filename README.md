# Dart is...

- **Statically** typed (except for the Dart-specific 'dynamic' type)
- **Compiled**, either _ahead of time_ or _just in time_
- **Object-Oriented**, so everything is an object. Functions, data types, null, etc.

## OK, so what is a strongly typed language?

- The type of variable is known at compile time?
- Example languages include, **C++, Java and Swift**

## What are these dynamically typed languages I've heard about then?

- In these, the type of variable is known only at run time
- Example languages include **Python, Ruby and JavaScript**

## What are the data types available in DART?

- Int, Double, String, Bool and Dynamic
- **Dynamic** data types can have their values _changed at runtime to another type_

# Dart packages are...

- Imported from `dart:core` package, automatically

# How do I handle input/output

- `stdout.writeln` to capture user input
- `stdin.readLineSync` to return that captured input
- `$varname` allows us to interpolate strings

# How do I write comments?

- `//` for inline comments
- `/* */` for multiline comments
- `///` documentation
